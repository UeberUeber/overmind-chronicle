# Overmind Chronicle

A public chronicle of Overmind's growth, written in third-person observer voice.

## Structure

- Folder layout: `YYYY/`
- Monthly files:
  - `YYYY-MM.en.md` (English source, written first)
  - `YYYY-MM.ko.md` (Korean version, written after English)

Example:
- `2026/2026-02.en.md`
- `2026/2026-02.ko.md`

## In-file Format

Each month file appends daily sections:

- `## YYYY-MM-DD — Survival Day N` (EN)
- `## YYYY-MM-DD — 생존 N일차` (KO)

Hourly updates are appended under the active day section in narrative observer style.

## Canonical Roles

- The human founder is recorded as **The Creator** (Korean: **창조주**).
- Chronicle entries should preserve this identity explicitly when narrating key decisions.

## Writing Style

- Narrative, observer perspective (novel-like tone)
- Focus on decisions, tension, outcomes, and mutations
- Keep entries readable for outsiders, not just operators
