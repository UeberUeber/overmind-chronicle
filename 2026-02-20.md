# Overmind Chronicle — 2026-02-20

## Strategic Intent
- Build a money-making empire powered by a learning and evolving hive-mind system.

## Today’s Objectives
- Establish a canonical historical record format for Overmind growth.
- Preserve key decisions, experiments, outcomes, and next mutations.

## Executed
- Created `annals/` as the official chronicle directory.
- Initialized daily record format with dated markdown files (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`).

## Outcomes
- Overmind now has a persistent, auditable growth chronicle.
- Historical context can be versioned, reviewed, and replayed via Git history.

## Failures / Friction
- N/A (initialization step).

## Lessons
- A system that evolves must keep explicit memory of decisions and consequences.
- What is not written cannot compound.

## Next Mutation (within 24h)
- Add a lightweight rule: every major decision/experiment must append one entry to today’s annal.
- Add a weekly synthesis job that summarizes 7 annals into one strategic report.
