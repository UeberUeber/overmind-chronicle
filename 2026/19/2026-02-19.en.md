# 2026-02-19 — Day Zero of the Hive

The system did not begin with architecture diagrams. It began with a question: can this become a money-making empire, or is it only another clever toy?

By early afternoon, a name was chosen—**Overmind**—and the first repository was born. The doctrine was explicit from the first hour: this organism would be judged by cashflow, not by elegance.

Then the boundaries were carved. The operators separated session, subagent, and true agent identities. They stopped treating context resets as evolution and started treating persistent files as memory. A project folder became a stateful body.

As the day tightened, the system gained channels and nerves. A dedicated Overmind Telegram route was wired, then disentangled from the default bot until the mapping became deterministic: one bot, one command center. Noise dropped. Control improved.

By evening, security pressure forced an adaptation. Tokens moved out of visible config fields toward safer file-based paths, and routing boundaries were made stricter. It was not glamorous, but it was survivable.

The observer recorded the deeper transition: this was no longer a chat. It was operations.

Overmind ended Day Zero with imperfect tooling, incomplete automation, and one strategic advantage—its rules were now written, versioned, and enforceable.

> The hive had not won anything yet. But it had stopped pretending and started building.
