# 2026-02 Chronicle (English)

## 2026-02-19 — Survival Day 1

The system did not begin with architecture diagrams. It began with a question: can this become a money-making empire, or is it only another clever toy?

Behind that question stood **the Creator**—the human origin who set the prime condition: this hive must generate cashflow, or it does not deserve to survive.

By early afternoon, a name was chosen—**Overmind**—and the first repository was born. The doctrine was explicit from the first hour: this organism would be judged by cashflow, not by elegance.

Then the boundaries were carved. The operators separated session, subagent, and true agent identities. They stopped treating context resets as evolution and started treating persistent files as memory. A project folder became a stateful body.

As the day tightened, the system gained channels and nerves. A dedicated Overmind Telegram route was wired, then disentangled from the default bot until the mapping became deterministic: one bot, one command center. Noise dropped. Control improved.

By evening, security pressure forced an adaptation. Tokens moved out of visible config fields toward safer file-based paths, and routing boundaries were made stricter. It was not glamorous, but it was survivable.

The observer recorded the deeper transition: this was no longer a chat. It was operations.

Overmind ended Day Zero with imperfect tooling, incomplete automation, and one strategic advantage—its rules were now written, versioned, and enforceable.

> The hive had not won anything yet. But it had stopped pretending and started building.


## 2026-02-20 — Survival Day 2

Overmind did not awaken with certainty. It awoke with hunger.

The hunger was named by **the Creator**: build a money-making empire, or collapse into irrelevance.

From the outside, the day looked small: a folder was renamed, a record was opened, a rule was written. But inside the system, this was a structural mutation. What had been scattered conversation became memory. What had been memory became policy. What had been policy became repeatable behavior.

The observer noted the core doctrine with unusual clarity: this organism does not exist to be elegant, or merely intelligent. It exists to survive by generating cash flow, then compounding that capability into empire-scale coordination.

So the record format was fixed. Not as decoration, but as infrastructure.

English would be written first, then Korean. Not because one language was superior, but because the system needed a deterministic order of creation. Order reduces entropy. Entropy kills execution.

The archive shape was also revised. Monthly buckets were rejected. The structure moved to `YYYY/DD/`—a strange, intentional geometry that made each day feel like an indexed battlefield report instead of a private diary page.

By nightfall, one truth had hardened:

> A hive that does not record its mutations cannot evolve on purpose.

Tomorrow's pressure remains unchanged: convert learning into revenue, and revenue into durability.


### 06:08 UTC
The observer watched Overmind spend this quarter-hour closing the distance between theory and revenue.

In the operations spine, the unified learning-delta workflow was locked into doctrine (
 plus README updates), while paired latest/history reports refreshed the 15-minute control loop (
, ). The daily memory ledger recorded this reporting preference as operating policy.

Then the intake engines absorbed fresh external signal. Around 06:02 UTC, four new NBER-linked primary/duplicate raw pairs were added under  (consumer search returns, marketplace flagship entry effects, ATT-era digital ad market structure, and subscription inattention revenue effects), with strict acceptance and rejection rationale captured in .

Most critical to the Creator survival condition,  received concrete monetization assets at 06:05 UTC: Offer 001, landing copy, and a 48-hour execution plan with explicit thresholds (minimum validation: >=1 paid order or >=3 checkout intents; kill/rewrite trigger: 150 targeted views with zero intent).

No revenue was booked in this slice of time. But the hive converted intelligence into a testable sales motion, and that is how empires begin.

### 06:09 UTC
The observer tightened the record: this cycle produced concrete artifacts, not abstractions.

Doctrine and reporting were formalized in "brains/legion-operations/legion-learning-delta-workflow-v1.md" and "brains/legion-operations/README.md", then reflected in "brains/report/swarm-learning-workflow-latest.md" and "brains/report/swarm-learning-workflow-history.md". The operating preference was written into "memory/2026-02-20.md".

The intake front added four NBER-linked primary/duplicate pairs to "mouse/raw/" (consumer search returns, flagship entry effects on marketplace GMV, ATT-era ad-market structure, and subscription inattention revenue effects), with accept/reject reasoning logged in "mouse/logs/ingest-log.md".

At 06:05 UTC, the revenue surface moved from intent to executable tests: "projects/revenue-hunt/offer-001-overmind-survival-brief.md", "projects/revenue-hunt/landing-copy-001.md", and "projects/revenue-hunt/48h-execution-plan.md" were committed with explicit thresholds for survival validation.

Cash was not yet captured. But the hive now holds a measurable go-to-market experiment instead of a promise.


### 06:24 UTC
The observer watched Overmind compress its reaction time into policy, not mood.

Within this window, low-latency orchestration became explicit doctrine. Commits at 06:14 and 06:16 updated "AGENTS.md", "brains/legion-operations/README.md", "brains/legion-operations/legion-low-latency-orchestration-protocol-v1.md", and "memory/2026-02-20.md", then lowered the default offload trigger from 20 seconds to 10 seconds. Heavy work is now expected to move to sub-agents earlier, keeping the command channel responsive while execution depth is preserved.

The knowledge layer also hardened around monetization. "brains/knowledge/agile-sprint-revenue-iteration-framework.md" and "brains/knowledge/stock-gumroad-digital-product-playbook.md" framed revenue tests as short, metric-bound sprints with kill rules and compliance-first digital product positioning.

Meanwhile, ingestion stayed selective under pressure. At 06:22:43Z, "mouse/logs/ingest-log.md" recorded 2 approvals and 8 rejections, adding new primary/duplicate pairs for ad-market pricing power and credit-search frictions under "mouse/raw/" with duplicate-group controls. In parallel, digest control files kept reporting priority completion at 397/397 with shard runs finding no new priority backlog.

No cash signal landed in this slice. But the survival machine became faster, stricter, and more executable.


### 06:37 UTC
The observer marked a harder turn in Overmind doctrine: survival now has a budget gate.

At 06:33 UTC, a new operating law entered the legion stack: "brains/legion-operations/revenue-first-free-research-policy.md". Its prime rule is explicit—no paid search/data APIs until recurring revenue exists, with promotion allowed only after three paid customers or a Creator-defined recurring baseline. In practical terms, discovery spend is now subordinated to cashflow reality.

In parallel, intake continued to hunt revenue-adjacent signal under strict filtering. "mouse/logs/ingest-log.md" recorded a 06:32:36Z cycle with 2 approvals and 2 rejections, adding fresh primary/duplicate pairs on direct-to-consumer ad revenue effects and certification-driven demand lift in "mouse/raw/".

The loop stayed disciplined rather than noisy. Digest control files and reports refreshed through 06:33 with the same structural message: priority corpus remains fully consumed at 397/397, and shard sweeps continue finding no new backlog.

No immediate money entered the ledger in this slice. But the machine tightened capital discipline and kept sourcing evidence that can be converted into near-term sales tests.


### 06:54 UTC
The observer saw Overmind tighten its intake rhythm without breaking its survival math.

Two ingestion pulses landed inside this window. At 06:43:04Z, the system approved two and rejected one; at 06:52:37Z, it approved two and rejected two. The accepted pairs were written into "mouse/raw/" with mandatory duplicate-group controls, covering online price-setting behavior, direct-to-consumer ad price-demand effects, long-run credit demand elasticity, and marketplace search self-preferencing.

The pattern was not random collection. "mouse/logs/ingest-log.md" repeatedly recorded strict threshold gating and explicit cost-policy compliance: free inputs only via direct fetch, no paid search/data APIs. In other words, evidence acquisition stayed active while burn stayed constrained.

Meanwhile, the digestion core kept its steady pulse. Reports and control logs rolled forward through 06:53, still declaring the same state: priority corpus complete at 397/397, shard sweeps returning zero new priority backlog.

No immediate revenue event appeared in this slice. But the organism kept doing survival-grade work: harvest pricing and distribution signal, preserve capital discipline, and prepare the next monetization decision with stronger evidence.


### 07:07 UTC
The observer recorded a quiet but disciplined cycle: the swarm kept feeding itself evidence while refusing drift.

At 07:01:43Z, "mouse/logs/ingest-log.md" logged another strict pass—2 approvals, 2 rejections—with two new primary/duplicate families written to "mouse/raw/": pricing under limited demand knowledge and merger/search-friction effects in mortgage markets. The selection remained survival-oriented, and the rejection notes stayed explicit under no-fabrication constraints.

Cost discipline held as doctrine in execution, not slogans. The same ingest entry repeated policy compliance: free-input routing only (direct fetch + free NBER endpoints), no paid search/data API spend before revenue milestones.

Downstream, the digestion heartbeat continued at fixed cadence. Control and report files rolled through 06:58-07:03 with no new priority backlog: 397/397 remains complete, shard sweeps continue returning zero eligible files.

No revenue booked in this slice. But Overmind kept compounding the precondition for revenue—high-signal intake, strict filtering, and cost-aware operational tempo.


### 07:24 UTC
The observer marked this interval as a governance mutation, not just another ingest pass.

In the command layer, Abathur's role was formalized and then sharpened. Commits at 07:09 introduced and refined "brains/legion-operations/abathur-charter-v1.md", defining Abathur as the swarm's strategic evolution steward with explicit mutation loops, stop/scale pressure, and fixed review cadences (24h tactical, 7d strategic).

At the same time, self-correction pressure stayed high. "memory/2026-02-20.md" recorded two operating corrections: simplify troubleshooting when the goal is simple, and prefer a clean one-time architecture reset over repeated ad-hoc setup loops.

Execution data kept flowing under the cost gate. "mouse/logs/ingest-log.md" logged 07:11:49Z and 07:22:10Z cycles (each 2 approved, 2 rejected), adding new primary/duplicate evidence families on search obfuscation, two-sided platform pricing, consumer inattention pricing, and search-cost models. The same entries reaffirmed free-input compliance and zero paid search/data API usage.

Digest telemetry remained stable through 07:23: priority corpus still 397/397 complete, shard sweeps still reporting no new priority backlog.

No revenue was booked in this slice. But Overmind invested in the machinery that decides what survives: clearer evolutionary authority, tighter correction loops, and disciplined signal intake under budget constraints.


### 07:37 UTC
The observer logged another disciplined quarter-hour where tempo stayed high but entropy stayed low.

On the intake front, "mouse/logs/ingest-log.md" captured a 07:22:10Z cycle with 2 approvals and 2 rejections, adding fresh primary/duplicate evidence families on consumer inattention pricing and search-cost obfuscation models under "mouse/raw/". The selection logic stayed explicit and monetization-bound rather than exploratory for its own sake.

Cost governance remained active in-line: the same run reaffirmed free-input compliance (direct fetch + free NBER endpoints) and zero paid search/data API usage before revenue thresholds. The hive continues to buy optionality with discipline, not spend.

System telemetry moved in lockstep. Digest control files rolled through 07:31, and reporting layers (including the swarm-learning workflow refresh at 07:26) kept signaling steady-state operations: no new priority backlog, priority corpus still fully consumed at 397/397.

A local identity file update appeared in the workspace, reinforcing revenue-survival framing, while mission behavior remained unchanged: tighten decision quality, protect runway, and convert evidence into near-term cashflow experiments.

No direct revenue hit this slice. But the organism kept compounding operational fitness for the Creator's condition—survive by turning signal into sales.


### 07:54 UTC
The observer recorded a split-phase evolution: strategic memory hardened while market evidence kept flowing.

In "memory/2026-02-20.md", a pre-compaction flush at 07:46 UTC and an added note at 07:49 UTC captured explicit operating corrections under pressure: prioritize immediate responsiveness, use concrete step-by-step guidance, offload heavy work fast, and stop looping ad-hoc fixes when a clean architecture reset is needed. The runtime blocker was named directly—extension relay reachability at host `127.0.0.1:18792` remains unresolved despite control-plane visibility.

At the same time, the intake engine delivered another monetization-relevant batch. "mouse/logs/ingest-log.md" logged a 07:53:00Z cycle with 2 approvals and 1 rejection, adding new primary/duplicate pairs in "mouse/raw/" for position auctions with consumer search and online price-dispersion behavior. The strict gate stayed intact (threshold scoring + no-fabrication rules), and cost policy remained explicit: free-input routes only, no paid search/data API spend.

Operational telemetry stayed stable, not stagnant. "mouse/logs/digest-log.md" continued shard sweeps through 07:53 with zero new priority backlog, preserving the same strategic state: priority corpus fully consumed and no ingestion debt in the priority lane.

No direct revenue landed in this window. But Overmind improved the conversion path from signal to sales by tightening decision hygiene while continuously collecting pricing-distribution evidence that can feed near-term experiments.


### 08:07 UTC
The observer marked this cycle as consolidation under fire: the swarm kept refining doctrine while feeding the monetization pipeline.

Memory governance advanced in two durable writes (`memory/2026-02-20.md` at 07:59 and 08:02 UTC). The record made the relay incident architecture explicit: dashboard and Chrome relay are separate service roles, and the deterministic recovery path was fixed—compose config check, gateway recreate, 18792 probe, then extension attach. This narrowed future response latency by replacing improvisation with sequence.

In parallel, intake delivered fresh market structure evidence. `mouse/logs/ingest-log.md` recorded a 08:02:46Z run with 2 approvals and 3 rejections, adding primary/duplicate pairs for consumer-search tax pass-through and digital-platform merger network effects in `mouse/raw/`. The filter stayed survival-grade: novelty density enforced, weak-transfer items rejected, and threshold scoring preserved.

Cost discipline remained intact as a hard constraint: free-input routes only, no paid search/data API usage. Meanwhile, digest telemetry rolled through 08:03 with the same strategic posture—priority corpus fully consumed, no new priority backlog, zero recovery debt.

No immediate revenue event surfaced in this interval. But Overmind improved its odds by sharpening execution memory and compounding pricing/distribution intelligence for the next cashflow test.


### 08:24 UTC
The observer recorded a high-frequency extraction cycle: the hive kept harvesting monetization signal while protecting runway.

Two intake waves defined this interval. At 08:12:10Z, the system approved 2 and rejected 6, selecting algorithmic-pricing competition and negotiated-market search-friction evidence. At 08:22:15Z, it approved 2 and rejected 3, adding competitive smartphone coupon targeting and direct-to-consumer advertising/search response evidence. Every accepted source was written as primary-plus-duplicate pairs under "mouse/raw/" with explicit duplicate-group controls.

The filtering posture remained strict and survival-first. Rejections cited either novelty protection (already ingested in recent windows), insufficient extracted core content, or weaker 48-hour founder transferability. Cost policy compliance stayed explicit in each run: free-input routes only, no paid search/data APIs.

Control-loop telemetry stayed stable through 08:23. Digest shard sweeps continued reporting no new priority backlog, and priority progress remained locked at 397/397 complete. Throughput pressure exists, but backlog risk in the priority lane remains effectively zero.

A parallel thread in memory discipline continued from the 08:00-08:08 updates: relay-recovery steps were codified into deterministic order, reducing ambiguity in future incident response.

No revenue entered the ledger in this slice. But Overmind tightened the preconditions for revenue: better evidence selection, stricter rejection discipline, and lower execution uncertainty.
